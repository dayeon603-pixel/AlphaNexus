# AlphaNexus — Quant Signal Overlay

> A Chrome browser extension that injects a floating quantitative analysis overlay into Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, and Google Finance. Shows multi-timeframe directional predictions, confidence intervals, regime state, and risk metrics — computed from real market data using professional-grade quant models.

This repository contains the public-safe architecture, interface definitions, dashboard components, and demonstration modules for AlphaNexus.

**Proprietary components** — including signal calibration, IC-weighted ensemble construction, MLE parameter estimation, confidence mapping, and position sizing logic — **are intentionally excluded or replaced with mock implementations**. The widget will display structurally valid output using standard academic defaults, but does not contain the real predictive engine.

Standard academic algorithms (RSI, ATR, GARCH term structure, transition matrix multiplication) are included in full as they are well-known published methods.

## What It Does

AlphaNexus detects the ticker on the current page and runs a full quant pipeline in the background. Results appear as a draggable overlay widget:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All data is fetched from the Yahoo Finance v8 Chart API. All computation runs in the extension's background service worker — no external servers, no data collection.

## Quant Models

### GJR-GARCH(1,1) — Volatility

Captures asymmetric volatility (leverage effect): negative shocks increase volatility more than positive shocks of equal magnitude.

$$h_t = \omega + \alpha \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \gamma \varepsilon_{t-1}^2 \mathbf{1}[\varepsilon_{t-1} < 0] + \beta h_{t-1}$$

Fitted via MLE using the Adam optimiser with analytical score functions (gradient of Gaussian log-likelihood via recursive derivative equations). No coordinate search heuristics.

**Term structure** for multi-horizon variance (Engle & Bollerslev 1986):

$$\mathbb{E}[h_{t+k}] = \sigma^2_{LR} + \varphi^k (h_t - \sigma^2_{LR}), \quad \varphi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma/2$$

Cumulative variance for horizon $H$ is computed in closed form — no simulation required.

### HMM — Regime Detection

Two-state Hidden Markov Model (Bull / Bear) fitted via Baum-Welch EM on daily log returns.

Initialisation uses variance-sorting: the bottom 60% of observations by absolute return are assigned to the Bull state (low-volatility regime). This is economically justified — bull markets exhibit lower volatility than bear markets — and produces more stable EM convergence than arbitrary index splitting.

Regime probability is propagated forward using the transition matrix to give regime forecasts at each horizon.

### Signals — TSMOM, OU, VWAP

Three orthogonal signal sources combined via IC-weighting:

**Time-Series Momentum (TSMOM)** — Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen (2012):

$$s_t = \text{sign}(r_{t-12m,\,t-1m}) \times \frac{\sigma_{\text{target}}}{\hat{\sigma}_t}$$

Volatility-scaled to target annualised vol of 40%.

**Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mean Reversion:**

$$\Delta X_t = a + b X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$

Fitted via OLS. Half-life $= \ln(2)/\kappa$ where $\kappa = -\ln(1 + b)$. Positions expressed as a z-score of the deviation from the OU equilibrium.

**VWAP Deviation** (intraday, when minute data available): z-score of close relative to rolling VWAP, using volume-weighted average price.

### IC-Weighted Ensemble

Signals are combined proportionally to their rolling information coefficients (rank correlation with subsequent returns):

$$w_k = \frac{|IC_k|}{\sum_j |IC_j|}$$

This downweights signals whose recent predictive power has degraded.

### Risk Metrics

Full risk profile computed from daily returns and price series:

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| Sharpe | $(E[r] - r_f) / \sigma \cdot \sqrt{252}$ |
| Sortino | $(E[r] - r_f) / \sigma_{\text{downside}} \cdot \sqrt{252}$ |
| Calmar | Annualised return / Max drawdown |
| VaR 95% | 5th percentile of historical return distribution |
| CVaR 95% | Mean of returns below VaR 95% |
| Omega | $\sum r^+ / \sum |r^-|$ |

## Architecture

Chrome Extension Manifest v3. Three separate JS bundles, zero external dependencies at runtime.

**Why a service worker?** Yahoo Finance API calls require CORS-safe requests that content scripts cannot make directly. The service worker runs in the extension context and can fetch any permitted host. Results are cached in `chrome.storage.session` with a 5-minute TTL.

**Why pure DOM (no React)?** The content script is injected into third-party pages. Bundling React would increase the payload from ~15 kB to ~150 kB, and React's reconciliation overhead is unnecessary for a widget that updates at most once per page load.

**SPA navigation:** Yahoo Finance is a React SPA. URL changes do not trigger full page reloads. A `MutationObserver` on `document.body` detects URL changes and re-runs ticker detection and analysis automatically.

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dayeon603-pixel/AlphaNexus.git
cd AlphaNexus
npm install
npm run build      # outputs to dist/
```

Load in Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → **Load unpacked** → select the `dist/` folder.

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "5.x",
    "webpack-cli": "5.x",
    "babel-loader": "9.x",
    "@babel/preset-env": "7.x",

    "mini-css-extract-plugin": "2.x",
    "copy-webpack-plugin": "11.x"
  }
}
```

No runtime dependencies — all quant models are implemented from scratch in vanilla JS.

## Data Source

Yahoo Finance v8 Chart API:

```
GET https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{ticker}
    ?interval={1m|1h|1d|1wk|1mo}&range={5d|60d|2y|5y|10y}
```

Five timeframes fetched per analysis:
- **Minute** (1m, 5d) — ~1950 bars, intraday signals
- **Hourly** (1h, 60d) — ~480 bars, short-term forecast
- **Daily** (1d, 2y) — ~504 bars, core model fitting
- **Weekly** (1wk, 5y) — ~260 bars, medium-term context
- **Monthly** (1mo, 10y) — ~120 bars, long-run vol baseline

Minute and hourly data are fetched best-effort; if unavailable (illiquid tickers, weekends), only daily/weekly/monthly forecasts are shown.
